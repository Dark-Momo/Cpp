1. std::thread th(FunctionName) will create a new thread and run it immediately. The thread function can't be overloaded. 
   So don't use an existing function name.

2. std::ref() and its purpose in CodeList.txt.

3. std::thread is C++ interface for multithreading, but it doesn't implement all necessary functions for multithreading 
   because we want a implementation portable to all platforms, and some platforms are limited.
   
   One function that C++ std::thread doesn't provide is setting the priority of thread.

   Thread affinity is to assign a thread on a specific core or not. Usually scheduler will move a thread on different core
   if it think necessary. But this move would involve context switch.

   native_handle() member function is something that the thread implementation would use to associate with the std::thread.
   It returns different value, and has different meaning for different platforms. See code example and CodeList.txt for this.

4. std::thread is implemented using RAII. What does this mean?
   When passing thread as a function argument, it can only be done with std::move(). Don't do it with value passing.
