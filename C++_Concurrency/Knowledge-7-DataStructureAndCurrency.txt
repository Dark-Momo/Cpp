1.  Concurrent Programming and Data Structure
    Concurrent programming even on different parts of a data structure could cause a problem. Program 20-1 is an example.
    We have 2 threads filling in a vector, each fills in 10000 elements. Vector has resize feature, if it is going to be 
    full to some extent, it will resize. 
    
    However, we have 2 threads here. When the vector occupied by one thread decides to resize, it will allocate new space, 
    move data, an delete the old one. But, the other thread will still add data to the old space, causing:
    ----------------------------
    malloc(): corrupted top size
    Aborted (core dumped)
    ----------------------------
