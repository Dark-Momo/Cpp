1.  Asynchoronous Programming
    Asynchoronous programming means several tasks runs at the same time, and one doesn't need another to finish.
    
    An example is, a task needs to get some data from backend. After issuing the request, it can wait for the
    data to come and then execute the next step (Synchoronous), or it can immediately work on its next step, and 
    when it gets to the function that really works on the data, it checks whether the data is ready (Asynchoronous).

    Asynchoronous programming can reduce blocking. Blocking can come from waiting for critical region, or join.
    
    Mutex/atomic operation is synchoronization between blockings.
    There is also non-blocking synchoronization. Threads communicates using concurrent queues. C++ itself doesn't
    have this kind of queue, while Boost, MicroSoft and Intel provides.

2.  Create a task
    The task here means an encapsulated execution sequences, or a function unit that deals with a special request.
    When we are talking about "asynchoronous" here, we mean Asynchoronous between Tasks.

    std::packaged_task, define in <future>, encapsulates a task.
    (1) A callable object for the task's code;
    (2) A std::promise stores the task result;
    It actually provides abstraction.

    std::packaged_task is a template class (actually functor class), with the callable object as its parameter.
    
    (1) // Callable object below is a function that take 2 int as input, and int as return.
        std::packaged_task<int(int, int)> pTask(...);
    
    (2) It has a get_future() member, associated with its std::promise();
    (3) It is move-only, can't be copied;
    (4) Task starts when operator() is called;
        - In the same thread, call it directly. Under this case, the current calling thread will stop and wait for the
          new task to finish. It is like calling a function, it is Synchoronous;
        - In a new thread, passing the task to std::thread's constructor. Under this case, the calling thread and the
          new thread will run concurrently;
