1. Thread Synchronization
   Synchronization between threads can be done using synchronization manager, like a global variable that every thread will check.
   Here, we will have possible data race since several threads will work on the global variable.

   The keypoint is, EVERY single access to a global variable should be protected by lock, even it is just a checking, like what we 
   have here in [15-2-ThreadSynchronization-WithLock.cpp - processData()].

   A good way for global variable checking is:
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
   std::unique_lock<std::mutex> progress_Lock(progressMutex);
   while(!progress_updated)
   {
       progress_Lock.unlock();
       std::this_thread::sleep_for(10ms);
       progress_Lock.lock();
   }

   // We get here when "progress_updated == true"
   progress_updated = false;
   std::cout << "ProgressBar - We received " << dataString.size() << " bytes data." << std::endl;

   progress_Lock.unlock();
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The synchronization based on global variables has problems:
   (1) Too many lock and unlock operations;
   (2) Too many while() loop;
   (3) When checking that flag is not ready, the thread goes to sleep. But how long should it sleep?

2. Conditional Variable
   Assume there are 2 threads, one writer, one reader.
   Conditional variable is a class defined in <condition_variable>. It has:
   (1) Member function - wait(), which takes a std::unique_lock as argument. It is blocking.
       Reader will call this. wait() will unlock the mutex, and block the reader thread until it receives a notification.

       It also has variations of wait_for() and wait_until(), which are non-blocking;

   (2) Memebr function - notify_one(), which scheduler will decide which one to wake up, and not the control of program. 
       and notify_all().
       Writer will call this.

   [Lost Wakeup]
   In order to make wait() - notify_one() pair work, wait() must be able to start before notify_one()/all(). 
   Otherwise, if notify_one() runs first, then wait() starts, wait() will miss the signal, and wait there forever.
   
   [Spurious Wakeup]
   Some times, wait() will be waked up even though notify_one()/all() is not called. It is possible due to the implementation 
   of the std::condition_variable.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Solution to Lost Wakeup and Spurious Wakeup - Condition Variable with Predicate.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Predicate is usually a bool variable. It is initialized to false, and be checked by condition variable when calling wait().
   When notify_one()/all() is called, predicate is set to true.
   (1) If it is false, the conditional variable will keep running on wait(); 
   (2) Otherwise, it will jump to the lines after wait() 
   It is something like:
   ------------------------------
   while (!predicate)
       wait(std::unique_lock());
   ------------------------------

   * If Lost Wakeup happens, predicate in Writer has been set to true, so Reader still can know that a notification has been sent.
   * If Spurious Wakeup happens, Reader got a notification, but predicate is false, so it knows this notification is spurious.

   See "15-5-ThreadSync-CondiVar-WithPredicate-MultiTh.cpp" for details about wait() with predicate and notify_one().

   wait() - Blocking;
   wait_for()/wait_until() - Non-blocking;

   Usually, you should set/unset predicate when it is still locked. 
   See [15-6-ThreadSync-DownloaderExample.cpp].

3. Futrue and Promise - Data transfer between threads
   C++ doesn't provide a way to do this. 
   Thread task function can have return value, but it will be ignored since std::thread doesn't provide return value.
   (1) Shared variable can be a way, but it needs lock for access;
   (2) Condition variable can sync threads, notifying another thread that a shared variable is changed;

    But these are not direct way to transfer data from one thread to another.

    std::promise & std::future
    - They together create a shared state of transfering data between threads;
    - No shared variable, and no explicit lock needed;
    In core, they have a producer - consumer mechanism. The Producer (std::promise) generates some result which will be saved into 
    shared state, while the consumer (std::future) will get also in the shared state. In brief:
    std::promise - Generate to shared state;
    std::future  - Get from shared state;

    std::promise is usually paired with std::future; 
    However, std::future, which represents results that are not yet available, works with many asynchronous objects and operations, 
    not just std::promise. std::future can be obtained from std::promise, or returned from an asynchronous operation.
