1. Thread-Level Parallelism (TLP)
   Parallelism is to divide task into several sub-tasks, which don't need to interact with each other so they can
   run on different cores concurrently.

   While concurrent programming explained previously needs interaction between threads, and can run on only 1 core.

2. C++ Standard Algorithm
   C++ Standard Algorithm is a set of standard library functions which implements classic operations like
   searching, sorting, copying, populating, and so on. They usually work on data container or sequence, not raw data.

   Most of them are in <algorithm>, with few in <numeric>.
